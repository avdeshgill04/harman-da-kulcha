EVERYTHING IS DONE ON YOUR PC. Only 2 things left (in the browser + one command):

1. CREATE THE REPO ON GITHUB
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: harman-da-kulcha
   - Public, leave everything else empty (no README)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. PUSH (run in PowerShell)
   cd "c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Harman Da kulcha"
   git push -u origin main

3. TURN ON PAGES
   - On the repo page: Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, folder: / (root) → Save
   - Wait 1–2 min, then open: https://avdeshgill04.github.io/harman-da-kulcha

Done!
